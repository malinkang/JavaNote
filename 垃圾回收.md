## 垃圾回收

### WeakReference和SoftReference

WeakReference与SoftReference都是可以用来保存对象的实例引用，这两个类与垃圾回收有关。

WeakReference保存的对象可以被GC回收掉。这个类通常用于在某处保存对象引用，而又不干扰该对象被GC回收。

```
import java.lang.ref.WeakReference;

public class WeakReferenceTest {

    /**
     * @param args
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A a = new A();
        a.str = "Hello, reference";
        WeakReference<A> weak = new WeakReference<A>(a);
        a = null;
        int i = 0;
        while (weak.get() != null) {
            System.out.println(String.format("Get str from object of WeakReference: %s, count: %d", weak.get().str, ++i));
            if (i % 10 == 0) {
                System.gc();
                System.out.println("System.gc() was invoked!");
            }
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {

            }
        }
        System.out.println("object a was cleared by JVM!");
    }

}

```

执行结果

```
Get str from object of WeakReference: Hello, reference, count: 1
Get str from object of WeakReference: Hello, reference, count: 2
Get str from object of WeakReference: Hello, reference, count: 3
Get str from object of WeakReference: Hello, reference, count: 4

object a was cleared by JVM!

```
SoftReference是强引用，它保存的对象实例，除非JVM即将OutOfMemory，否则不会被GC回收。

```
import java.lang.ref.SoftReference;

public class SoftReferenceTest {

    /**
     * @param args
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A a = new A();
        a.str = "Hello, reference";
        SoftReference<A> sr = new SoftReference<A>(a);
        a = null;
        int i = 0;
        while (sr.get() != null) {
            System.out.println(String.format("Get str from object of SoftReference: %s, count: %d", sr.get().str, ++i));
            if (i % 10 == 0) {
                System.gc();
                System.out.println("System.gc() was invoked!");
            }
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {

            }
        }
        System.out.println("object a was cleared by JVM!");
    }

}
```
